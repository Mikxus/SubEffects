# SubEffects 0.2.0v
This library intends to provide an easy way to create and use light effects with different led strips. You can find information for the led chips supported by [FastLED](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED#supported-led-chipsets) library.
>**! Library is still under development. Many things will be added or removed.**

# Light modes
**Bass color**
>**Index 0**
> In this mode the color is changed by the bass frequencies. The brightness is changed by the loudness of signal.
> The bass frequency detection is implemented by using [arduinoFFT](https://github.com/kosme/arduinoFFT) library.
> **! Note** this mode uses the **timer1** to collect samples of the audio.

# How to use


# API

**Useful for just using the library.**

* **SubEffects**( uint8_t audioPin, uint8_t led_dataPin, **CFastLED** & fastLedObj, **CRGB** ledObj[ ] );
   >Used to initialize the library.
   > Takes the following arguments. 
   > 1. Analog pin's number 2.  Led's Data pin 3. FastLED object 4. CRGB led array

* void **NextMode**( );
  > Increments the lighting mode by 1. 
  > **!** Overflows if exceedes the lighting mode count.
* void **PreviusMode**( );
  > Decrements the lighting mode by 1.
  > **!** Overflows to highest lighting mode.
 
* void **SetMode**( uint8_t mode );
  > Sets the lighting mode to the corresponding number.
  > **!** Allowed values 0 - 255

* void **CalibrateSoundLevel**( );
  >Calibrates for the dc offset. The calibration takes 1.5 seconds.
  >Useful for preventing the leds blinking randomly.
